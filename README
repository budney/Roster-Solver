Roster-Solver

The Roster::Solver module provides methods for generating a duty
roster given a list of dates, jobs to be done, and workers, subject
to the following constraints:

    1. Each worker's eligibility to do each job.
    2. Each worker's availability on each date.
    3. The number of workers needed for each job.

For all jobs, the solver will try to divide the workload evenly
among the eligible workers, and space out their duties as much
as possible.

In addition, you can identify some jobs as "exclusive," meaning the
worker will do no other jobs on the same date as an exclusive job.
The solver will try to do that anyway, but for exclusive jobs it's
a requirement for a roster to be valid.
